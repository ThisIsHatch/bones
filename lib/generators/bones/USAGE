Description:
    This creates Hatch's standard spec templates for use with the scaffold generator. Once run the
    scaffold will generate Hatch's standard controller and specs leaving far less to be customised.

Example:
    rails generate install user manager admin

    This will create:
      lib/templates/rails/scaffold_controller/controller.rb
      lib/templates/rspec/scaffold/controller_spec.rb
